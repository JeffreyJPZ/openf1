# Introduction

OpenF1 is an open-source API that provides real-time and historical <span style="white-space: nowrap;">Formula 1</span> data.

The API offers a wealth of information, including lap timings, car telemetry, radio communications, and more. Whether you're looking to create interactive dashboards, dive deep into race analysis, or even develop connected objects that light up every time your favorite driver takes the lead, OpenF1 makes it all possible.

Historical data is freely accessible and requires no authentication. Real-time data access, however, requires a paid accountâ€”apply by filling out <a href="https://tally.so/r/w2yWDb" target="_blank">this form</a>.

Data can be accessed in either JSON or CSV formats, making it user-friendly for both developers and non-developers alike.
For a quick start, you can access the API through your web browser. A sample URL is provided for each endpoint for easy reference.
